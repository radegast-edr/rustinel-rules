This is the **trusted, versioned, and CI-tested** detection-content repository for Rustinel.

```text
rustinel        →  the engine that collects telemetry and evaluates rules
rustinel-rules  →  the Sigma / YARA / IOC packs it loads   (this repo)
```

Each detection lives **once** in `rules/`, carries a stable `id`, and is referenced from **packs** by that id. CI validates every change and builds flat, zipped packs plus an `index.json` catalog the engine can load directly.

---

## Load a pack in 60 seconds

> Need the engine first? Grab it from the **[Rustinel repo](https://github.com/Karib0u/rustinel)** — then come back here for real detections.

**1. Download** the pack for your OS plus `index.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Karib0u/rustinel-rules/releases/latest), and unzip it:

```bash
unzip windows-essential-0.2.0.zip
```

**2. Point** `config.toml` at the unzipped pack — a pack folder *is* the directory Rustinel loads:

```toml
[scanner]
sigma_rules_path = "windows-essential/sigma"
yara_rules_path  = "windows-essential/yara"

[ioc]
hashes_path      = "windows-essential/ioc/hashes.txt"
ips_path         = "windows-essential/ioc/ips.txt"
domains_path     = "windows-essential/ioc/domains.txt"
paths_regex_path = "windows-essential/ioc/paths_regex.txt"
```

**3. Confirm it works.** The Essential packs ship the **EICAR** test IOC set — drop a standard EICAR test file on disk and Rustinel raises an IOC alert in `logs/alerts.json.<date>`.

> Packs are **cumulative**, so load **one** pack, not several. The exact paths for every pack are in each pack's `engine` block in `index.json`. Full reference: **[docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md)**.

## Packs

Higher levels `extend` the one below, so rules are never duplicated:

```text
Essential  ⊂  Advanced  ⊂  Hunting
```

| Pack                  | Level     | Default | Description                                                          |
| --------------------- | --------- | :-----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Windows Essential** | essential |   ✅    | Low-noise, high-confidence Windows detections. Safe default.         |
| **Windows Advanced**  | advanced  |   ❌    | Essential + broader production detections. More FPs may occur.       |
| **Windows Hunting**   | hunting   |   ❌    | Advanced + broad/noisier hunting content for analysts.               |
| **Linux Essential**   | essential |   ✅    | Low-noise, high-confidence Linux detections. Safe default.           |
| **Linux Advanced**    | advanced  |   ❌    | Essential + broader Linux detections (persistence, exec).            |
| **macOS Essential**   | essential |   ❌    | _Experimental._ Keychain theft, Gatekeeper bypass, cryptominers.     |
| **macOS Advanced**    | advanced  |   ❌    | _Experimental._ Essential + launch-item persistence, cradles, exec.  |

> **macOS packs are experimental and post-v1** — not yet production-ready, so both ship `default: false`. See [docs/packs.md#macos](docs/packs.md#macos) for current limits.

Full catalog and per-pack rule inventory: **[docs/packs.md](docs/packs.md)**.

## Versioning & compatibility

`rustinel-rules` is versioned **independently** from the engine — detection content evolves faster. Each pack manifest declares the engine version it needs:

```yaml
pack_schema_version: 2
requires_rustinel: ">=1.0.2"
```

Release artifacts ship zip packs, `index.json`, compatibility metadata, and a `sha256` per artifact.

---

## Develop

Build and validate packs locally with the pinned tooling ([uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```bash
uv sync                                 # install pinned tooling
uv run python tools/validate.py         # Detection as Code: must pass
uv run python tools/build_packs.py      # build dist/<pack>/ + zips + index.json
uv run python tools/build_catalog.py    # build the website catalog (dist/catalog.json)
```

```text
rustinel-rules/
├── rules/            # Canonical source — each artifact exists ONCE
│   ├── sigma/<os>/   # Sigma rules (.yml)
│   ├── yara/<os>/    # YARA rules (.yar)
│   └── ioc/<os|common>/  # Typed IOC sets (hashes / ips / domains / paths_regex)
├── packs/            # Pack manifests — reference artifacts by id, never copy
├── schemas/          # JSON Schema for pack.yml and IOC sets (v1)
├── tools/            # Build + validation tooling
└── dist/             # Build output (gitignored): packs + zips + index.json
```

New detections should be TTP/Atomic-based, mapped to ATT&CK, and compatible with Rustinel telemetry. Start with **[docs/authoring.md](docs/authoring.md)** and **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

## Guiding principles

- Start small — a few proven detections beat many noisy ones.
- Keep Essential strict and low-FP; no noisy defaults.
- Each rule lives once; packs reference it by id.
- Keep Rustinel usable out of the box, with quality made visible through CI.
- Prefer TTP / telemetry-based curation; use CTI to **prioritize**, not to bulk-import.
